Good job for the first assignment! Your assignments ends up with a "87", with "-5" for your wrong answers in Q3, please try again; "-5" for your scant comments/remarks in script, which is emphasized many times by Prof. Zhu; "-3" for you didn't try N from 0 to 100 in Q4.3. Keep going!

## Comments for HW2 -- Chenyy
Good job for the first assignment! Your assignments ends up with a "95", with "-2" for your missing of pointing out which year stand out in Q3.10; "-3" for your scant comments/remarks in script. 

Here are some additional suggestions: Try not to show the reports with several "warnings", which kind of mess up your report. Please find some useful massage to avoid or turn off the warnings. For example, the link here will be helpful for `SettingWithCopyWarning` warning: https://www.dataquest.io/blog/settingwithcopywarning/.

Wrong nino region, better to recheck. But right processing methods. (-1p)

Good job! I shall give you full point (30/30).
It would be better to try to turn off or ignore the `warning`s, in case they will mess up your reports. As for adding the x y labels, please try `ax.set_xlabel` instead of `plt.xlabel`.

Great job! I shall give you full point (45/40).
Your report is neat and organized. Nice try on Q1.4, I will give you “+5” bonus. As for the error ” cannot unpack non-iterable numpy.float64 object”, could you please try the solution on https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54273077/cannot-unpack-non-iterable-numpy-float64-object-python3-opencv. Keep going!
