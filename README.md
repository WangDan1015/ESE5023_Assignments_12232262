## Comments for HW1 -- Chenyy
Good job for the first assignment! Your assignments ends up with a "87", with "-5" for your wrong answers in Q3, please try again; "-5" for your scant comments/remarks in script, which is emphasized many times by Prof. Zhu; "-3" for you didn't try N from 0 to 100 in Q4.3. Keep going!
