Good job for the first assignment! Your assignments ends up with a "87", with "-5" for your wrong answers in Q3, please try again; "-5" for your scant comments/remarks in script, which is emphasized many times by Prof. Zhu; "-3" for you didn't try N from 0 to 100 in Q4.3. Keep going!

Good job for the first assignment! Your assignments ends up with a "95", with "-2" for your missing of pointing out which year stand out in Q3.10; "-3" for your scant comments/remarks in script. 

Here are some additional suggestions: Try not to show the reports with several "warnings", which kind of mess up your report. Please find some useful massage to avoid or turn off the warnings. For example, the link here will be helpful for `SettingWithCopyWarning` warning: https://www.dataquest.io/blog/settingwithcopywarning/.
